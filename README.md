Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrianhajdin/react_native-restate.git
cd react_native-restate
```

**Installation**

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_GALLERIES_COLLECTION_ID=

Replace the values with your actual Appwrite credentials. You can obtain these credentials by signing up & creating a new project on the [Appwrite website](https://apwr.dev/JSM050).

 npx expo start
```
